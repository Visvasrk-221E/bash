# Introduction

This is a bash demo or tutorial course sort of thing, that I am currently self learning from a book.
The name of the book is linux fundamentals, which deals with the fundamentals of the linux filesystem.
It also has its manual for the bash commands. 
Additionally this introduction session also involves covering the tutorials from the w3schools.com.
I will also be covering the bandit in the overthewire war games and document it on the go.

### Further developments will take place.
- This is a part of my skill escalation program. 
- Do not just think, act accordingly. This is the motto.
