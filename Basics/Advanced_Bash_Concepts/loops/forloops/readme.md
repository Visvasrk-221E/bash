#for

- The for loop iterates over a sequence, such as a list of filenames, variables,
or even group of values generated by running some command. Inside the forloop, we define a block of commands that are run against 
each value in the list,and each value in the list is assigned to a variable name we define.

#Syntax

	for variable_name in LIST; do
		# run some commands for each item in the sequence
	done
